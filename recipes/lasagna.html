    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Meat Sauce</strong>
            <p>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic 
                in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well 
                browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato 
                sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with 
                sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 
                1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel 
                seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 
                1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Lasagna Noodles</strong>
            <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to 
                a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water 
                for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse 
                with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine 
                ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons 
                parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Assembly</strong>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. To assemble, 
                spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom 
                of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles 
                lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of 
                the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the 
                mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups 
                meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 
                1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top 
                with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. 
                Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either 
                spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the 
                foil does not touch the cheese.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Bake</strong>
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove 
                the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes. 
                Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving. Enjoy!!</p>
